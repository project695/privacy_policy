        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Updated on: 01/14/2020</p>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>In these Terms of Service, the following terms are employed with the meanings set out
            below:</p>
        <p><b> Account:</b> The Member’s dedicated personal area within the Application, which he or she
            accesses when he or she registers and connects to the Application. It enables the
            Member to access the Services. A Member may only have one Account.</p>
        <p><b>Application:</b> The ByeEx application, available on the Apple App Store and the Google
            Play Store and on the ByeEx WebApp : <a href=""> http://eworksense.com/</a></p>
        <p><b>Boost:</b> A function enabling Members to increase the visibility of their profile during the
            time that this option is activated.</p>
        <p><b>Facebook Connect:</b> A feature enabling Members to use their Facebook account to log in
            to the Application, in order to simplify the registration process.</p>
        <p><b>Female Members:</b> Members registered on the Application as female.</p>
        <p><b>Male Members:</b> Members registered on the Application as male.</p>
        <p><b>Member:</b> A person registered with the Application.</p>
        <p><b>Member Characteristics:</b> Information provided by the Member describing his or her
            lifestyle and personal characteristics on the profile. The Member can choose the
            information he or she wishes to appear on the profile and filter other Members on the
            Application based on this information.</p>
        <p><b>Packs:</b> Bundles of Charged Services purchased by Members.</p>
        <p><b>Premium Member:</b> A Member who has a ByeEx Premium subscription.</p>
        <p><b>Profile Certification: </b>a function that enables the authentication of a Member’s Profile
            picture(s) to obtain the “Certified Profile” badge, which enables other Members to see
            that the photo of the Member’s face posted on his or her profile corresponds to his or
            her real visual identity while moving (via the video).</p>
        <p><b>Profile Photos:</b> photos on your profile enabling the easy identification of the Member.
            The Member accepts to, at the very least, provide a photo of his or her face in which he
            or she is clearly recognizable, and place it in first position. These two criteria combined
            are an essential condition for using the Services.
            
            If the photo of the Member’s face is not placed in first position, it will be automatically
            placed in first position by default. If the Member has several photos of his or her face,
            he or she will be able to choose their order of appearance.</p>
        <p><b>Services:</b> All services, whether charged or free-of-charge, offered by ByeEx to encourage
            virtual or real-life meet-ups between Members who have crossed paths and who have a
            mutual interest in one another, according to the selected search criteria.
            TOS: These Terms of Service.</p>
        <p><b>Video Call:</b> feature offered only to Members who have a Crush, enabling them to call
            and talk to each of their Crushes spontaneously, for a limited duration. This feature can
            be accessed from the “Messages” page, by clicking the icon in the top right corner
            to start the Video Call. During the Video Call, Members have access to the following</p>
         <ul><p>option</p>

         <p>The TOS define the rights and obligations of the parties when using the Application.
            They form the basis of the contractual relationship between the Member and ByeEx.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>.1 Conflicting Rules</li>
            <p>These Terms of Service (TOS) determine the main rules of use for the Application. They
                are supplemented by additional policies – the <a href=""> Privacy Policy</a>, the <a href=""> Cookies Use Policy</a>
                and the <a href=""> Confidence Charter</a> – in order to provide the Member with clearer guidance on
                how to use the Application. In the event of a conflict between the various policies
                making the rules inaccessible, unintelligible and/or unpredictable, these TOS shall
                prevail over the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Use Policy and the Confidence Charter.</p>
            <li>2 Independence of Provisions</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Article 2: Amendments to the TOS</h2>
            <ul>
               <b>2.1 Updates</b>
               <br>
               <p>ByeEx reserves the right, unilaterally and at any time, to add to or amend these TOS as it
                sees fit or to terminate the Services.</p>
            <p>The Member will be informed of updates to the TOS via the Application and/or by email
                sent to the address provided by the Member. It is the Member’s responsibility to ensure
                that this email address is valid.</p>
            <p>It is the Member’s responsibility to carefully read the updated TOS and to be fully aware
                of any changes ensuing from said updates.</p>
            <p>Complete acceptance of the changes is implied by the Member’s continued use of the
                Application’s Services following the updates.</p>
            <p>Should the Member not agree with changes made to the TOS, he or she has the option
                to end the Services and delete his or her Account as per Article 15.3.</p>
            </ul>
          
            <ul>
                <b>2.2 Immediate Effect</b> <br>
                All new versions of the TOS shall be effective immediately for all Members.
            </ul>

          <ul>
              <b>3.1 Governing Law</b>
              <br>
              <p>These TOS shall be governed by French law, exclusive of its conflict of laws rules.</p>

          <ul>
              <b>3.2 Dispute Resolution</b>
              <br>
              <p>In the case of dispute, the Member agrees to contact ByeEx directly in writing (by email
                or letter, to the email or postal address provided in article 16 hereof) prior to taking any
                judicial or extra-judicial action, in order to try and find an amicable settlement to this
                dispute.</p>
            <p>In the case of failure, the Member is informed that he or she may choose to have
                recourse to mediation, free of charge, and submit its dispute to the Online Dispute
                Resolution platform proposed by the European Commission, which may be accessed at
                the following address: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/."> http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.</a></p>
            <p>Any challenge or dispute related to the formation, interpretation, performance or expiry
                of these TOS or in any connection therewith which has not been amicably settled shall
                be submitted to the relevant courts of Paris (France).</p>
          </ul>
          <h2>Article 4: Registration</h2>
          <ul>
              <b>4.1 Application Download Options</b>
              <br>
              <p>The Application is available on the Apple and Google official download platforms and
                via la ByeEx WebApp, which is free to access at this address: http://eworksense.com/ .
                It can be downloaded free-of-charge from the Apple App Store and the Google Play
                Store, on iPhones running version iOS 10 or higher, and Android Smartphones running
                version 5 or higher.</p>
              <b>4.2 Member’s Rights when Registering</b>
              <p>Provided that the required conditions for Member status are met, ByeEx shall assign the
                Member a personal Account, which includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A profile page</li>
                    <li>An inbox</li>
                    <li>A “notifications” option</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A Member may only have one Account.</p>
             <b>4.3 Obligations of the Member when Registering</b>
             <br>
             <p>The Member must be over the age of 18, and must guarantee that all information
                provided when registering is true and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>Registration can be done in these ways:</p>
            <p>-via the Facebook Connect: the social network enables ByeEx to use the Member’s
                profile photo, first name, age calculated based on date of birth in order to create a
                “profile” page. Consequently, the Member must check the accuracy of his or her
                Facebook information before registering with the Service.</p>
            <p>-via a cell phone number: in this case, no information on the Member may be
                automatically retrieved and it is his or her responsibility to supply personal information
                such as first and last name, sex, date of birth as well as other additional information if
                desired and one or more personal photos at the time of registration.</p>
            <p>- Via Apple or Google Sign in: it is the Member’s responsibility to provide information
                relating to him or her, such as first name, last name, gender, date of birth, and other
                additional information if he or she wishes. The Member must also provide one or more
                photos of himself or herself when registering.</p>
            <p>- Via the ByeEx WebApp via Facebook Connect or Google Sign in.

                Upon registration, the Member accepts these TOS and the Privacy Policy and agrees to
                fulfill his or her obligations, and particularly those set out in the Member Code of
                Conduct defined in Article 8 of these TOS.</p>
          </ul>
          <h2>Article 5: Services and Features</h2>

              <p>ByeEx is an online dating application enabling Members to find, in the Application,
                people with whom they have crossed paths or may cross paths, and people in whom
                they may be interested based on their search preferences or profile activity or their
                Member Characteristics. This Application is for personal and recreational use only.

            <p>The Services offered by ByeEx may in no case be likened to a counseling or marriage
                bureau service. Its sole aim is to facilitate virtual or real-life meet-ups through the
                Application between Members with mutual interests, according to their locations and

               </ul>
               <p>Charged services provided via the Application are available to Members after
                purchasing a Pack or a ByeEx Premium subscription, the conditions of which are set out
                in article 9.</p>
          </ul>
          <h2>Article 6: Protection of Personal Data</h2>
              <ul>ByeEx is very concerned with the protection of your personal data and the respect of
                your privacy. We suggest that you read our Privacy Policy and our Confidence Charter
                carefully to better understand how we process your personal data, available by clicking
                on the following links:</ul>
                <ul>
                    <a href="https://www.happn.com/en/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> <br>
                    <a href="https://www.happn.com/en/trust/">Confidence Charter</a>
                    
                </ul>
                <h2>Article 7: ByeEx’s Obligations and Liability</h2>
                <ul>
                    <b>7.1 Technical Resources and Security</b>
                    <br>
                    <p>ByeEx agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a
                        high-quality service to Members with an iPhone device running operating system
                        version iOS 10 or higher, an Android Smartphone running version 5 or higher.
                        ByeEx cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Member’s device or for any
                        compatibility issue between the Application and the device.</p>
                    <p>In addition, every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to ByeEx’s
                        system are minimized. In this respect, ByeEx uses a firewall or equipment located
                        between the Internet and the company’s private network, in order to make its security
                        more robust by filtering traffic to and from the internet. It is, however, impossible to fully
                        guarantee the security of a network.</p>
                    <p>ByeEx is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the
                        Member’s internet provider Services, or for any cause beyond ByeEx’s control which
                        might interrupt or have an adverse effect on access to ByeEx Services.
                        The Member must have access to a secure email account. If such a precaution is not
                        taken, or even if it is, while this probability remains low, the Member’s Account may be
                        vulnerable to fraud.</p>
                    <p>ByeEx shall also endeavor to avert Members of any exceptional risk of receiving spam
                        Messages or Messages claiming to have been sent by ByeEx. The Member must be
                        attentive and vigilant in order to avoid being the victim of scams and report any of the
                        above circumstances to ByeEx by sending a letter or email to the address provided in
                        Article 16 hereof.</p>
                    <b>7.2 Illegal Conduct</b>
                    <br>
                    <p>ByeEx and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal
                        or which incur criminal penalties, including but not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All types of scams,</li>
                            <li>All activities of a commercial or professional nature,</li>
                            <li>Prostitution,</li>
                            <li>Identity theft,</li>
                            <li>An infringement of a third-party intellectual property right,</li>
                            <li>An infringement of personal rights, such as image rights and the respect of the right to
                                privacy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b>7.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System</b>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a hosting provider and pursuant to Article 6.I-7 of the French Trust in the Digital
                        Economy Act of June 21, 2004, ByeEx has no legal obligation to monitor the content
                        sent or stored via the Application.</p>
                    <p>However, according to Article 6.I-3 of this law, as a hosting provider, ByeEx must set up
                        a reporting and community moderation system in order to report some unlawful,
                        abusive and prejudicial content.</p>
                    <p>In such case and after due verification by Customer Service, ByeEx commits to promptly
                        remove the said content.</p>
                    <p>Pursuant to Article 6.I-5 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act: the knowledge
                        of illicit content is deemed effective when the hosting provider is notified of following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The content transmitter’s identity</li>
                            <li>The description of the facts in contention (possibly with screen shots of the content)</li>
                            <li>As well as the reasons for which the content must be removed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>ByeEx has therefore equipped the Application with a reporting and community
                        moderation system, allowing Members to report the content described in Article 6.I-7 of
                        the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act if it constitutes apology for crimes against
                        humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to racial hatred,
                        incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child
                        pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.</p>
                    <p>Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with
                        violent or insulting Members as well as unlawful, abusive or prejudicial content, ByeEx’s
                        team takes this reporting procedure very seriously, which may also be implemented in
                        the case of statements contrary to accepted social etiquette.</p>
                    <p>Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, including using the Vidéo
                        Call feature, the transmitter’s account can be suspended or terminated according to the
                        conditions set forth in Article 15.4. This decision is based on the proof given by the
                        report’s author and is made in order to ensure the withdrawal of the content in
                        compliance with ByeEx’s legal obligations.</p>
                    <p>The Member having originally published the reported content will in no case be
                        informed of the identity of the report’s author.</p>
                    <p>Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another
                        Member whose conduct does not comply with the rules of etiquette in order to prevent
                        any conversation with him or her (mutual prevention of access to Likes, Hellos,
                        FlashNotes (if eligible), Messages and voice messages that have been sent in the past
                        and of sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a
                        Member who has been blocked, particularly if they think this Member is bothering them
                        in one way or another). This action is confidential and enables
                        Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.
                        This reporting system is accessible and operational:
                        • On an iPhone: at the top right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the top right of the
                        conversation with the Member in question;
                        • On an Android Smartphone: at the top right of the Member’s profile photo, and at the
                        top right of the conversation with the Member in question;
                        Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of
                        law or regulations, the Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit
                        a complaint to the appropriate police authorities.</p>
                    <p>The reporting system put in place by ByeEx does not replace any complaint and judicial
                        procedure against a Member who authored the reported content.
                        Any misuse of the community moderation system or any unjustified reporting of a
                        Member shall be considered a breach of these TOS, and penalties may be imposed
                        including Account suspension/termination, pursuant to Article 15.4 of the TOS,
                        besides application of penalties pursuant to Article 6.I-4 of the French Trust in the
                        Digital Economy Act or even legal proceedings, under which damages may have to be
                        paid to victims.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, the Member is solely liable for checking the identity of the Crush with whom
                            they may want to engage in a Video Call and organize a “virtual” meetup. ByeEx may not
                            be held liable for any incidents occurring during a “virtual” meetup.</p>

                        <p>Any use of ByeEx Services to organize a group meeting of its Members constitutes a

                        <br>
                        <p>ByeEx advises Members who wish to arrange “real-life” meet-ups to be vigilant.
                            Members are solely responsible for verifying the identity of those with whom they meet.
                            “Real-life” meet-ups are arranged independently of ByeEx and are the sole responsibility
                            of Members. ByeEx cannot be held liable for any acts or problems of any type which
                            have been committed or caused by Members and/or former Members when such
                            events occur following use of the Application. In this respect, one of the intended
                            benefits of the ByeEx messaging service, again to ensure that Members remain safe
                            and free from harassment, is to enable Members to decide which people should be
                            allowed to see their profiles and talk to them.</p>
                        <p>As regards the people with whom the Member has agreed to exchange Messages, it
                            is recommended that Members do not too readily reveal information which is not
                            included in the profile such as a phone number, address or surname. For safety

                            A missed call does not count as a used Video Call. However, a Video Call is deemed
                            used as soon as the Members are in communication.</p>
                        <p>Please note that Video Calls are limited in time: as soon as the Members are in

                            This is why ByeEx has no control over reimbursement of your purchase. Any requests
                            related to payment must be sent to your Store.</p>
                        <p>ByeEx does not collect any banking information. Your bank details are collected and

                            the term of the previous subscription. Upon receipt of the payment made automatically
                            to your Store, ByeEx approves your purchase and updates your account by giving you
                            access to ByeEx Premium for a period corresponding to the amount charged.
                            If you wish to circumvent this automatic renewal at the end of the subscription term set
