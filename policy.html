                                    notifications received, notification preferences, etc.)</li>
                                <p>When you access our Services and use the Application and its features, information on
                                    the way you use them is collected and processed. <b> Most of the information collected by
                                    ByeEx is necessary to the provision of its Services.</b> Without this data ByeEx cannot
                                    supply the Services linked to the ByeEx application.
                                    More specifically, this includes your registration date, login dates, on or offline status,
                                    the type and number of interactions with other Members (such as FlashNotes, Hellos,
                                    Likes, crossings, and Crushes), with the third-party accounts connected to your Account
                                    (such as Spotify, Instagram), or the number of transactions made (purchases of Hellos,
                                    FlashNotes, or subscriptions), notifications received and notification preferences.</p>
                                <li><b>Geographical positions and Crossing points with other Members (public)</b></li>
                                <p>The Application’s main value and purpose is to allow Members to find other Members
                                    they have or may have crossed paths. Your Geographical position is collected with your
                                    express consent only. In fact, you will be asked to authorize the collection and
                                    processing of your location data to allow ByeEx to identify your crossing points with
                                    other Members who have agreed to be geolocated.</p>
                                <p>Unless you have chosen stricter settings on your device, ByeEx will collect your
                                    Geographical position regularly.</p>
                                <p>When the Geographical positions of two Members are within a certain radius, ByeEx
                                    pinpoints a Crossing point.</p>
                                <p>Your Crossing points will be displayed on your profile, but Members with whom you
                                    cross paths can never see your exact location. Each Member sees his/her location
                                    when the Crossing point was registered in a radius defined by ByeEx. They cannot see
                                    the other Member’s location.</p>
                                <p>During your registration, if you do not provide your consent for geolocation, you must
                                    provide the name of your city. This information will enable ByeEx to suggest profiles of
                                    Members near you.</p>
                                <p>These Crossing points can be displayed as a news feed or on a Map (Mapping).</p>
                                <p>You may, at any time, withdraw your consent by disabling geolocation on your
                                    smartphone. If you choose to do so, your news feed will no longer be updated, and you
                                    will not be able to see who you have crossed paths with after disabling the geolocation
                                    option. When you have no more profiles in your newsfeed, we will ask you the name of
                                    your city in order to suggest new Member profiles near you.</p>
                              <p>You can also ask that your profile, and therefore your crossing points, are no longer
                                displayed on the Map (Mapping). In this case, you will only appear in the news feed of
                                other Members. Equally, you will no longer be able to see the profiles of Members you
                                have crossed paths with on the Map (Mapping); you will only see these profiles on your
                                news feed. For this, go to the application and click on “My preferences” then go to the
                                bottom of your screen and disable the option “Share my crossing cluster”.</p>
